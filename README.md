# **Welcome to Low-Level Programming!**
This repository holds my assignment solutions from the low-level programming 
track at ALX Africa  Software Engineering School.

# **Whats in here?**
I am learning about data
structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while
working in the C language. 
The following contains hands-on projects as listed below:

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
* [0x03. C - debugging](./0x03-debugging)
* [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
* [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x06. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)


- more projects are coming soon!!
