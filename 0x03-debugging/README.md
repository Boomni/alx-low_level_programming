# C - Debugging
***
Errors in code are called **bugs** and they can affect the compilation of a program<br><br>
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. More advanced programmers and industry engineers use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

## In this project I learned about the following:
 * What is debugging
 * Some methods of debugging manually
 * How to read the error messages

## Tasks:
_**0. Multiple mains**_
  * [0-main.c](./0-main.c): Tests that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

_**1. Like, comment, subscribe**_
  * [1-main.c](./1-main.c): Solution to task below.
    * Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
    * Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
    * You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.

_**2. 0 > 972?**_
  * [2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c): This program prints the largest of three integers.

_**3. Leap year**_
  * [3-print_remaining_days.c](./3-print_remaining_days.c):This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
